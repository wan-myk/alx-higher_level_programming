# Solutions to tasks on JavaScript - Web scraping

**Working with JSON data**
- The workflow of accessing the attributes of a simply-created JSON object by Jimmy Tran from Cohort 1 - San Francisco
request module
- Modern JS

**Learning Objectives**  
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using fs module

__Requirements__

**General**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using node (version 10.14.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- You are not allowed to use var

**More Info**  
- Install Node 10  $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
- $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs  
- Install semi-standard  
- Documentation  
- $ sudo npm install semistandard --global  
- Install request module and use it  
- Documentation  
- $ sudo npm install request --global  
- $ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules  
**Notes**: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, it’s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
